# tuya_withConfigFlow

A simple modification I made to the home assistant Tuya component.  This custom component adds a config flow file.  This allows Tuya to be configured from the Integrations UI and all tuya entities are added to the device registry.

Copy the tuya folder to your home assistant instance at '''config/custom_components'''. 
Restart home assistant.
Look for Tuya on the list of integrations under "Configuration > Integrations > '+'"
Enter your Tuya or SmartLife login information
